# NABI HEALTH

NABI is a preventive and supportive emotional well being app focusing on truly knowing oneself through understanding one’s thoughts, emotions, feelings and behaviour through self reflection and awareness.

Based on the philosophy of Know Thyself  - NABI’s mission is to empower people through self inquiry and reflection to gain deeper insight into oneself and seek appropriate mental and emotional well being support.  

Is to create a community where people feel safe to explore and talk about their emotions because when we understand ourselves better, we do better and that creates a positive effect within oneself and to others.
