# Better Together

We understand that sometimes we cannot expect our family and friends to understand us completely. Every time we are distressed we cannot seek a therapist and sometimes the solutions are simple and all we need is a listening ear or a good cry or words of comfort.

Our volunteer team at NABI is here to support you in your time of distress or any questions you may have to talk more about mental health and emotional well being, what it means, how to seek the right support, what is therapy and what it entails. Sharing something personal for the first time may not be easy yet we all need someone to truly listen and help us to make sense of our emotions when we are unsure or lost.

You don’t have to figure out everything by yourself, therefore it’s always Better Together.

You will get 40 min of free chat time with our team in a month, post which if you’d like to continue with us you have a choice to subscribe and continue with unlimited support from our volunteers.
